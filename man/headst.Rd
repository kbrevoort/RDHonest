\description{
Subset of Ludwig-Miller (2007) data. Counties with missing poverty rate, or
with both outcomes missing (\code{hs} and \code{mortality}) were removed. In
the original dataset, Yellowstone County, MT (\code{oldcode = 27056}) was
entered twice, here the duplicate is removed. Yellowstone National Park, MT
(\code{oldcode = 27057}) is also removed due to it being an outlier for both
outcomes. Counties with \code{oldcode} equal to (3014, 32032, 47010, 47040,
47074, 47074, 47078, 47079, 47096) matched more than one FIPS entry, so the
county labels may not be correct. Mortality data is missing for Alaska.
